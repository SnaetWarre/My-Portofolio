### What I'm Building
I build systems that bridge the gap between heavy AI research and real-world edge devices.
*   **Currently:** Building an offline-first Neural Network in **Rust (Burn)** that runs on smartphone CPUs.
*   **Previously:** RAG Chatbots in .NET & Full-stack Web Apps.

**Don't read the code, read the story:**

        <p><strong>Imagine standing in a greenhouse. You spot a small, discolored patch on a tomato leaf.</strong></p>
        <p>Is it just nutrient burn? Or is it <em>Late Blight</em>, a pathogen that can decimate your entire harvest in 72 hours? In the current agricultural model, you have two bad choices: spray expensive chemicals "just in case" (wasting money and hurting the soil), or send a sample to a lab and wait 3 days for results. By the time the phone rings, your crop might already be gone.</p>
        
        <p>This project started with a simple mission: <strong>Give the farmer a lab-grade diagnosis in 3 seconds, not 3 days.</strong></p>
        
        <p>But building this required us to break almost every standard rule of modern AI deployment. We had to ditch the Cloud, abandon Python, and throw out our specialized hardware.</p>

        <h2>The Edge AI Constraint in Agriculture</h2>
        <p>Farms are notoriously hostile environments for tech. There is often no 5G, no Wi-Fi, and certainly no fiber connection to an AWS server. If our AI needed an internet connection to work, it was useless.</p>
        <p>We needed <strong>Edge Computing</strong>—processing data right there on the device. But "Edge" is a buzzword. Making it work economically is an engineering nightmare.</p>

        <h3>Hypothesis vs. Reality: The Hardware Trap</h3>
        <p>Initially, we followed the industry playbook. We bought an <strong>NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano</strong>. It's the gold standard for Edge AI—a dedicated €350 computer with 8GB of Unified RAM designed specifically to run neural networks.</p>
        <p>We thought we were done. Then we ran the benchmarks.</p>
        
        <p>We pitted the specialized Jetson against a standard consumer laptop (Ryzen 7 / RTX 3060) and a high-end smartphone. The results forced a complete pivot.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Device Target</th>
              <th>Inference Latency</th>
              <th>Throughput</th>
              <th>Cost to Farmer</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Laptop (RTX 3060)</strong></td>
              <td><strong>~15 ms</strong></td>
              <td><strong>~65 img/s</strong></td>
              <td>€0 (Already owns it)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Jetson Orin Nano</strong></td>
              <td>~120 ms</td>
              <td>~8 img/s</td>
              <td>€350 + Setup</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Standard CPU</strong></td>
              <td>~250 ms</td>
              <td>~4 img/s</td>
              <td>€0</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><strong>The realization was brutal:</strong> Why ask a farmer to spend €350 on a complicated Linux box that is <em>slower</em> than the phone already in their pocket? The 8GB shared RAM on the Jetson also became a bottleneck, crashing whenever we tried to load larger batch sizes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Pivot:</strong> We scrapped the Jetson. The future wasn't dedicated hardware; it was <strong>BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)</strong>. But to run a neural network on <em>any</em> device (laptop, phone, tablet) without installation headaches, we needed a radical software shift.</p>

        <h2>David vs. Goliath: Rust (Burn) vs. Python (PyTorch)</h2>
        <p>If you want to run AI on a phone browser or a random laptop, you can't ask the user to "please install Python 3.10, create a virtual environment, and pip install torch (2.4GB)."</p>
        <p>We needed something lightweight, portable, and fast. We chose <strong>Rust</strong> and the <strong>Burn</strong> framework. To prove this wasn't just a hipster choice, we benchmarked it against the industry titan, PyTorch.</p>

        <h3>The "Why Rust" Benchmark</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Metric</th>
              <th>Burn (Rust)</th>
              <th>PyTorch (Python)</th>
              <th>The Reality</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Deployment Size</strong></td>
              <td><strong>~24 MB</strong></td>
              <td>~7.1 GB</td>
              <td><strong>Rust is 300x smaller</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Startup Time</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Instant</strong> (<0.1s)</td>
              <td>~3.0s</td>
              <td>User experience critical</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Inference Speed</strong></td>
              <td>1.27 ms</td>
              <td><strong>0.59 ms</strong></td>
              <td>Negligible difference</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>While PyTorch was technically faster by 0.6 milliseconds (on an RTX 3060), it required a 7GB environment. <strong>Burn compiled down to a single 24MB binary.</strong></p>
        <p>This was the key. With Rust, we could deploy the same model to a high-end server, a local desktop app, or—via WebAssembly—directly to the browser on a phone.</p>

        <h2>Making the AI Smarter (Cheaper)</h2>
        <p>Hardware and software were solved, but data remained a problem. Expert-labeled agricultural datasets are rare and expensive. We couldn't afford to label 50,000 images.</p>
        <p>We implemented a <strong>Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)</strong> loop. We trained the model on just <strong>20%</strong> of our data, then let it "teach itself" by making predictions on the remaining 80%. If the model was more than 90% confident in a prediction, we accepted it as truth and retrained.</p>
        
        <div class="blog-image-wrapper">
          <img src="images/dashboard-gui.png" alt="Model Diagnostics Dashboard showing bias analysis" class="blog-image" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450">
          <div class="blog-caption">Figure 2: Our custom diagnostics dashboard tracking the model's self-learning confidence.</div>
        </div>

        <p>The result? <strong>We tripled the value of our manual labor.</strong> The model achieved accuracy comparable to one trained on 60% fully labeled data, drastically reducing the barrier to entry for adding new crop types.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project proved that "Edge AI" doesn't always mean buying new sensors and devices. Sometimes, the most powerful edge device is the one you already own.</p>
        <p>By moving from Python to Rust, and from dedicated hardware to a BYOD architecture, we turned a €350 hardware problem into a €0 software solution. The result isn't just a research paper; it's a tool that can run in a disconnected field, on a 4-year-old phone, and potentially save a harvest.</p>
